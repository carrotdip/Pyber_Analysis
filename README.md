# PyBer Ride Share Analysis
## Overview
The purpose of this investigation was to analyze trends in the PyBer ride sharing data based on city type to create better informed business decisions. The data was first grouped by the city type: Urban, Suburban, or Rural. The total number of rides per city were then compared to the average fare. The data was then visualized with a bubble chart, with the size of the bubbles correlating to the driver count of that particular city for increased readability. The distribution for the number of rides per city type, numbers of drivers per city type, and average fare per city type was then calculated and visualized with a simple box-and-whisker plot. The percentages of total rides, fares, and drivers per city type was then determined and graphed with pie charts. Finally, the total fare per city type was then visualized on a line graph for visualization of the amount of total revenue of each city type over time.

## Results

Figure 1 shows the total numbers of rides per city compared to the average fare. The size of the bubbles relates to the number of drivers per city. It was found that cities that had more rides had lower average fares. The amount of drivers, on the other hand, does not appear to be linked to the cost of rides, as there are various sized bubbles scattered throughout the graph with no clear trend. There is no obvious connection between these two parameters.

Figure 2 shows the distribution of the number of rides per city type. The average numbers of rides for urban, suburban, and rural cities are 24, 17, and 6, respectively. The average number of rides for suburban cities is about 3x the amount of rural rides. The mean number of rides for urban cities is roughly 1.5x that of the suburban cities, and 4x that of rural cities. An outlier, which is a value over 2 standard deviations away from the mean, was also found in the urban city data. It is highly unusual for urban cities to have more than 38 rides.

Figure 3 shows the distribution of the average fare amount per city type. The average fare for urban, suburban, and rural cities are approximately $24, $31, and $37, respectively. The average fare for rural cities is approximately 1.5x that of urban cities and 1.25x that of suburban cities. It is clear that the further away one is from the city, the higher the fare would be. This is likely correlated to the amount of drivers, which is described in the following figure.

Figure 4 reveals the distribution for the number of drivers for each city type. The average number of drivers for rural, suburban, and urban cities are 4, 16, and 37 respectively. There are roughly 4x more drivers in suburban cities and 9x more drivers in urban cities when compared to rural cities. The distribution also tends to noticeably broaden when there are more drivers.
