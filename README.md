# PyBer Ride Share Analysis
## Overview
The purpose of this investigation was to analyze trends in the PyBer ride sharing data based on city type to create better informed business decisions. The data was first grouped by the city type: Urban, Suburban, or Rural. The total number of rides per city were then compared to the average fare. The data was then visualized with a bubble chart, with the size of the bubbles correlating to the driver count of that particular city for increased readability. The measures of central tendency for the number of rides per city type, numbers of drivers per city type, and average fare per city type was then calculated and visualized with a simple box-and-whisker plot. The percentages of total rides, fares, and drivers per city type was then determined and graphed with pie charts. Finally, the total fare per city type was then visualized on a line graph for visualization of the amount of total revenue of each city type over time.
##Results

It was found that the greater the total number of rides was linked to  lower average fares.
